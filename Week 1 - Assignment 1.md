#### Reasons Why I Like/Don’t Like It

I like the X-Prime’s website because at first glance the yellow and purple color scheme is visually appealing and draws in the user. On the “Our Services” page, there remains a yellow and purple frame of the window and as you scroll the frame remains in place but the contents of the page change. I found this a unique way to navigate through a page. The visuals throughout different pages move which I found interesting but a bit distracting from the words, which were already a little too small in my opinion. The website is has a very simple layout with only four pages to navigate to. The mobile version is also very user friendly. 

*Website 2: http://www.condenast.com/advertising/*

#### Reasons Why I Like/Don’t Like It

I like Conde Nast because unlike X-Prime it has a very simple layout and color scheme.  The colors are tones of black and white, however, with the photos the website integrates the content well that the page does not look so bland. The words are also written in a simple font. I like how for the pages on the menu how the brands drop down and fill up the entire page. Then the user can click on the one he/she is interested in knowing more about. The pictures/video are of high quality and drive most of the focus for each page. The mobile version is user friendly as well. 


*Website 3: https://www.whatisblik.com/*

#### Reasons Why I Like/Don’t Like It

I like how What Is Blik’s header, which contains the logo and shopping cart. It remains frozen and follows the user when they are scrolling. Unlike other website, What Is Blik has their menu bar on the side. I personally am not a fan of the bar on the side but with the way they formatted the header I can see why that was done. The drop down however, fits horizontally on the screen for the pages which I do like instead of being on one side vertically. The pictures on the page are nice and large. Once you click on the “Shop” page, a sub menu bar comes up categorizing all the products. I like how the home page has a black background while other pages have a white background. The content is organized and not very busy. The FAQ’s are always at the bottom of the page incase the user has any questions which is easier than it being on a separate page.

### About Me

My name is Hima Mistry and I am a senior at Drexel University studying Business Administration with a double major in Finance and Business Analytics and minor in Interactive Digital Media. I chose to pursue a major in finance because I liked the idea that the decisions that were made in finance were dependent on the events that were happening around the world. Living in a technology driven society, I wanted to have exposure to innovation, which starts with the analysis of raw data. My curiosity led me to my double major in business analytics. However, a part of me always wanted to pursue my creative side during undergrad and minoring in interactive digital media fulfilled that desire. 

Over the course of my four years at Drexel, I was able to receive professional experiences in three different industries. My latest professional experience was at Goldman Sachs Asset Management in New York City. I was able to dive into investments in equity through a multitude of projects. I have developed critical thinking and problem solving skills by conducting analyses on stock attribution and portfolio construction. I gained advanced skills in Excel, in addition to the ability to think analytically by calculating annualized returns, information ratio, and upside/downside capture for value equity portfolios. At Grant Thornton, my second experience, I I was able to establish rapport with all levels of clients through multifaceted projects with seven different teams, develop financial valuations, and conduct fundamental market research. I conducted net present value  (NPV) calculations and analyzing financial statements resulting in $800K in cost savings. Lastly, at Chubb, an insurance firm, I was a international finance co-op where I prepared various financial statements, conducted monthly summaries and conversions. 

At Drexel, I am involved in Alpha Kappa Psi, a co-ed professional business fraternity, Delta Phi Epsilon, an international sorority and Dean's Student Advisory Board (DSAB) In Alpha Kappa Psi, I held two positions: Chapter Relations Chair and Rush Chair. As chapter relations chair, I coordinated with other chapters around the country to coordinate a joint professional event. As rush chair, I was in charge of planning five days of events for prospective members and overseeing a committee of 10 people. In Delta Phi Epsilon, I served as the Vice President of Finance and was accountable for the budget of the organization. As a board member for DSAB, I have acted as a liaison for the students and the Dean to implement improvements to the school. 

In terms of my career aspirations, I want to be working in client facing role that incorporates my technical skills and creative skills. I hope to work at Google as the Partner Marketing Lead for Google Cloud. I would be able to shape the future of Chrome and Google enterprise services around the world, defining our global marketing strategy to bring the magic of Google to consumers. I would be using both my quantitative and qualitative skills along with creative judgment to develop strategies for stakeholders.
