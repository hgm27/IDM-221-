# Assignment 1 
## Document Inspiration 

select a minimum of three websites you can draw inspiration from and document your selections. Tell me why you like the site, or why you don't like the site. Is there a particular aspect of the site you like/don't? Something about how it looks? Something about how it works? Do not explain how the site works or what is on the site; instead explain why it is interesting to you.










## Content Inventory 

Content Inventory: Content development is the key to success in web development. The number one reason students struggle with this class is because they do not have a clear definition of the content that will be included in the project. Document the following:
a minimum of four paragraphs about yourself
your professional resume
your professional contact information
professional logo (if you have one)
It would also be good to begin organizing pictures, graphics, videos, audio files and any other content or media you want to include in your project.

My name is Hima Mistry and I am a senior at Drexel University studying Business Administration with a double major in Finance and Business Analytics and minor in Interactive Digital Media. I chose to pursue a major in finance because I liked the idea that the decisions that were made in finance were dependent on the events that were happening around the world. Living in a technology driven society, I wanted to have exposure to innovation, which starts with the analysis of raw data. My curiosity led me to my double major in business analytics. However, a part of me always wanted to pursue my creative side during undergrad and minoring in interactive digital media filled that gap. 

Over the course of my four years at Drexel, I was able to receive professional experiences in three different industries. My latest professional experience was at Goldman Sachs Asset Management in New York City. I was able to dive into investments in equity through a multitude of projects. I have developed critical thinking and problem solving skills by conducting analyses on stock attribution and portfolio construction. I gained advanced skills in Excel, in addition to the ability to think analytically by calculating annualized returns, information ratio, and upside/downside capture for value equity portfolios. At Grant Thornton, my second experience, I I was able to establish rapport with all levels of clients through multifaceted projects with seven different teams, develop financial valuations, and conduct fundamental market research. I conducted net present value  (NPV) calculations and analyzing financial statements resulting in $800K in cost savings. Lastly, at Chubb, an insurance firm, I was a international finance co-op where I prepared various financial statements, conducted monthly summaries and conversions. 

At Drexel, I am involved in Alpha Kappa Psi, a co-ed professional business fraternity, Delta Phi Epsilon, an international sorority and Dean's Student Advisory Board (DSAB) In Alpha Kappa Psi, I held two positions: Chapter Relations Chair and Rush Chair. As chapter relations chair, I coordinated with other chapters around the country to coordinate a joint professional event. As rush chair, I was in charge of planning five days of events for prospective members and overseeing a committee of 10 people. In Delta Phi Epsilon, I served as the Vice President of Finance and was accountable for the budget of the organization. As a board member for DSAB, I have acted as a liaison for the students and the Dean to implement improvements to the school. 

In terms of my career aspirations, I want to be working in client facing role that incorporates my technical skills and creative skills. I hope to work at Google as the Partner Marketing Lead for Google Cloud. I would be able to shape the future of Chrome and Google enterprise services around the world, defining our global marketing strategy to bring the magic of Google to consumers. I would be using both my quantitative and qualitative skills along with creative judgment to develop strategies for stakeholders.
